				## AK-47

				The russian classic used by redfor and all the other friendly countries. It is still in use by some raiders and other people on the battlefield though it is soon changed to the AK-102.

				## AK-102

				After the redfor team realized that the AK-47 is a good but very old weapon they chose to switch to the brand new 102 instead of the old 47. After it became harder to get all of those AK-47's the raiders and bandits switched to the more modern 74-U as it is easier to get.

				## RPK

				Also a legend in russian conflicts and it is still in use by the redfor team though they improve on the MG part they still need to use the RPK while the new one is still in progress.

				## Blufor

				### The table and the descriptions are still work in progress!
