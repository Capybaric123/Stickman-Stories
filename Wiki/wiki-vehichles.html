				# Vehichles

				Vehichles in stickman stories are a big thing as the war is going on you will need armored vehichles to increase troops survivability in the battlefield, and it is quite expensive to do so.

				Here you will find all the information about the vehichles used in stickman stories, from cars, to jets, to tanks, and boats. Here will be a list of different vehichles used by redfor and blufor. I hope you will enjoy!

				## Redfor

				---

				<table> 
					<tr>
						<th>Planes</th>
						<th>Tanks</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SU-25</td>
						<td>T-60</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SU-27</td>
						<td>T-160</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				### SU-25

				The SU-25 is an old plane though redfor doesn't care about safety they are always trying to get as much firepower as possible! The SU-25 is old but reliable it is still being used in small air to ground operations.

				### SU-27

				The SU-27 is a reliable though not the most up to date fighter jet they have in mass production, it is still dominating in fights against countries with weaker planes but defenetely not blufor.

				### MIG-29

				The MIG-29 is an even newer plane to be used by redfor as it has more advanced electronics and it is still in use against blufor patroling the border, it is capable enough to conquer an F-16, but there is no guaranty that it will defeat it!

				---

				### T-60

				This is an old tank used by redfor for the reason of it's cheap build cost compared to the modern tanks, but the pay for that is big, it is slow, easily visible, big, easy to hit, and it is very old!

				### T-160

				After redfor realized that their T-60M's are not capable of wining against new tanks, they started the research to make a better tank that is more powerfull and able to at least protect itself and people near it, and it would've been a great thing if it was also not slow, to get to the fight before everyone has already killed eachother.

				## Blufor

				---

				### F-16

				The mighty F-16 viper, it is old but very capable and with blufor unlike redfor actually caring about their soldiers and pilots it is being improved each year based on it's previous weakneses. And even after it becoming 50 years old it is still dominating the sky!

				### FA-18

				The multirole fighter named F-18 is always up in the sky blufor's borders are constantly patroled by these, as they are able to defent both land and air. It is also quite old, but the same as the F-16 keeps on getting updates each year!

				### A-10

				The so called "Tank Buster" equiped the the 7 barrel GAU-8 avenger made by the same company that made your dishwasher, can erase anything from it's path, maybe it can't defend itself from redfor's fighters, but it is always protected by the F-18s and F-16s. And with it's Carlie variant it is even more destructive. Existing since the cold war it is still making all of the enemies pray that they will somehow survive.

				### AV-8

				The AV-8 is a navy aircraft capable of making vertical takeoffs and landings it is also a multirole fighter which can carry missiles and bombs. It is very old something like the SU-25 as it is it's opposite. Even being super old it is still very capable of clearing out small enemy bases and scaring away enemy helicopters.

				### E-3

				The so called "Eye of Sauron" E-3 is an AWACS aircraft equiped with a very big and powerfull radar on it's top, it looks funny and scarry at the same time, depending on which side is he. It is an essential for big fights in the air as it gives all of the friendly aircrafts data about where is the enemy hiding and also all needed data to destroy them.

				---

				### M1A2

				The M1A2 is a newer version of a dominating M1A1 Abrams. It's 120mm main cannon is very powerfull and can destroy anything in it's way without hesitation. Redfor is still scared of it as even their T-160 can't sustain the power of this jet powered beast of steel.

				### M1A1

				The M1A1 is the older but because of that weaker brother of the new M1A2. It was also invented during the period of the cold war and was used everywhere from the gulf war and conflicts to this day, you might question why is it still in use if there is a better version of it? The answer is that it is a reserve tank which is called in if there is not enough troops on the M1A2s.

				---

				And this is the end, sadly as you can see there is not that much other vehichles besides very popular ones, but this is only because the lore is still on finished and probably will never be so. And this is why you can always add your ideas in the github discussions, email them to me, or even fork the repo and add to the lorebook yourself! You are always free to do so, as the ***Stickman-Stories*** is about cooperation with the community! So, I hope you liked this page and don't forget to come later for new updates!
