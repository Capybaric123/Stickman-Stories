				# Vehichles

				Vehichles in stickman stories are a big thing as the war is going on you will need armored vehichles to increase troops survivability in the battlefield, and it is quite expensive to do so.

				Here you will find all the information about the vehichles used in stickman stories, from cars, to jets, to tanks, and boats. Here will be a list of different vehichles used by redfor and blufor. I hope you will enjoy!

				## Redfor

				| Cars | Jets | Tanks | Boats | Mechs |
				| :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
				| | SU-27 | T-90 | | V1 |
				| | SU-25 | T-160 | | |
				| | MIG-29 | | N/A | |

				## Blufor

				| Cars | Jets | Tanks | Boats | Mechs |
				| :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
				| N/A  | F-16 | M1A2  | N/A   | N/A   |
				| N/A  | F-18 | M1A1  | N/A   | N/A   |
				| N/A  | A-10 | N/A   | N/A   | N/A   |
				| N/A  | AV-8 | N/A   | N/A   | N/A   |

				---

				And this is the end, sadly as you can see there is not that much other vehichles besides very popular ones, but this is only because the lore is still on finished and probably will never be so. And this is why you can always add your ideas in the github discussions, email them to me, or even fork the repo and add to the lorebook yourself! You are always free to do so, as the ***Stickman-Stories*** is about cooperation with the community! So, I hope you liked this page and don't forget to come later for new updates!
