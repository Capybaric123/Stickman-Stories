                # Creators

                As it might seem that this is a small project, you are not quite right, since there is actually a lot of people working on the episodes for the comic, soon we will tell you about our team, but first let's talk about the author of the actual comic.
                
                ## Author
                
                Most people will probably think that the idea of the Stickman-Stories (which already sounds childish) was starting as a webcomic from the begining, **if you think so, then you are wrong!** initially the idea of creating Stickman-Stories appeared in 2020, and the plan was making it on paper and then printing it, but really soon after that we found out that this would be way more expensive than the team thought, so from that point (16/9/2020) the development of this site started, the Danny started learning HTML and CSS to create it, soon he realized that he won't be able to make it himself, so he got himself a small group of volunteers and here we come to the dev team...
                
                ## Dev Team
                
                The dev team was quiet small because the development didn't require that much of effort.
                
                The Dev Team consisted of:
                1. Daniil Sorokin: Lead developer - author
                2. **REDACTED**
                3. **REDACTED**
                
                ## The Art Team
                
                The art team was also small because drawing stickmans isn't that hard imagine :-|
                
                The Art Team consisted of:
                1. Daniil Sorokin: Lead developer - author
                2. **REDACTED**
                3. **REDACTED**
