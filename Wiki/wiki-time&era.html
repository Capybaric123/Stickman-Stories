                # Time and Era

                You might be interested "in **which era** is the story happening?", that's a good question. The answer to this is not quite simple... **the story begins in the 2020** and each episode of course the **time moves forward**.

                ## More Information

                If you are interrested in learning which guns and tech is used in that time in the comic, you can should probably see the [weapons](wiki-weapons.html), vehicles, and tech too, this will help you get the idea of what is happening in the story and also find out specs of the weapons used in the comic. And if you are a gun person just like me, I am quite sure that you will like spending some time just learning about guns you may never heard about before!
