                # Secrets

                You might think that there is no secrets for such a simple comic, but you are very wrong as there is a lot of secret stuff hidden in the code of the website.
                
                ## Secret pages
                
                There are a lot of forgotten pages in the source files of the website, one of them is the /scripts folder. At first the website might look innocent but people who were searching the source code found an interesting forgotten folder named scripts, and after finding it they typed in this in their search bars and were shocked `https://stickman-stories.ddns.net/scripts/p1.html` as they've found a secret forgotten page which even had the legacy style of the website before the site rework.
                
                ## Jekyll
                
                Next up we have the Jekyll secret pages. As we all know the stickman-stories website was made using Jekyll static page builder, but no one knew that because of this, you could type in the search bar any file and it's extension and be able to see the source code of it, what means that you could find some of the old GitHub user guides made by Daniil himself when the site was only launched. You can still find them in the markdown files if you search well.
                
                ## Info
                
                This page is still work in progress as people are still trying to find new secrets in the website, and maybe it can be even you! So grab your magnifying lens and try to help us find more secret pages!            </md-block>
