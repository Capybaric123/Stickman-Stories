				# Wiki

				Welcome to the Stickman-Stories wiki!

				This is an official wiki made to replace the old GitHub wiki, here you can find information about the comic and also some unique info as this wiki is maintained by the official Stickman-Stories group, what means that here you can find the official and cannon information. If you are interrested in lore though, you might need to check out the quite new "lore book" as it has the lore which is quite different from the contents of the wiki.

				### P.S.

				Also if you want to help us with the wiki page creation and maintenance you can always check out our <a href="https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/">GitHub</a> for information about the project and also email me to ask for contribution, all the links to my email are also in the github readme page, so what are you waiting for? Go and check it out! For any aditional information contact me via the same email. Good luck!
