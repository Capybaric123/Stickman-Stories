					## 01.04.2025

					Happy April's Fools day!

					Today I was a bit more productive, as I made a new **_dev_** branch and also I had made some pull requests. Besides that there is also some stuff I did.

					Out of all small changes I just wanted to highlight the info page updates though I am thinking of maybe deleting it and later, probably on the dev branch, make the info page send you to the github README.md

					Although I did some work I still think of what should I add for the 11<sup>th</sup> chapter, as I am still thinking on it, and sadly I still didn't come up with anything :(

					Besides the small bugfixes and a new dev branch I didn't add too much so I will probably go and think of a new chapter.

					Good bye!

					Hello, everyone!

					Today I feel very productive as I have used the super old and depricated marquee tag, as it is quite fun to use, though I didn't find to much stuff to implement it in.

					I was thinking on maybe starting the changelog again as it is quite old and it is not updated since 4<sup>th</sup> March, so I think that it is a good idea to finish all of the missing things up to date!

					I hope everyone enjoyed this update and this post.

					Good, bye!

					Today I was not that productive since I it was a weekend day and besides I also had some stuff to do, so I didn't really find time to work on the website today, though, as you can see I found some time! There is not that much to do, but I still think of finishing the tenth chapter and maybe making some small edits.

					---

					## 28.03.2025

					Long day, today I am planing on doing some work on the website since recently we were shut down by the DDNS provider so I think I will spend some time on maybe reworking some of the home page stuff, maybe make a teaser for the new comic release since I started recently working on it so I think it will be a good idea to do so. Besides all of that talking I am also planning on maybe adding some stuff to the lore book since it didn't have an update for a long time.

					Work aside, I recently swiched to a new keyboard so I will do some more streams on coding for the website since most of the time I don't do work at home, though I will graduate in a year and I will have some more time to spend at home so I think that after my grad I will be able to stream more on the coding progress!

					But it will be in a year and because of that for now it only will be on weekends and stuff, hollidays included. I will update the.

					## 04.03.2025

					It was a long time since I updated the blog and I was actually working on the website all of this time and I have some interresting things to tell! First let's start off with the new lore book update!

					After I updated the lore book table of contents I started to add more to the website and the lore in particular and I added way more chapters and stories and I am still open for people to submit their own ideas.

					Second, is that I added more stuff to the home page, changed some stuff in the CSS part of the code as those are long now separate from the actual pages. So not that much by itself but it makes up in total, as the website code incresed by two megabytes, which is a lot for a website.

					## 19.02.2025

					I am back with great news! We finally closed the wiki content issue and also of course we updated it, now there is a lot more of new and fresh content instead of the old and not accurate data. Though let's not talk about that right now. First of the biggest changes for today besides the wiki is the lore book.

					Some of you might've notices that the sublinks are not working, and I even know why they didn't though if you want to find out the complete reason you should go check the closed issues tab on github. But happily I fixed it and now they actually lead you to the stories themselves instead of not working at all!

					Besides that all. We have hit the 800 commits mark if you haven't noticed it in the announcements section of the home page for some reason...

					But that is pretty much it for today, and it is a way more longer post than the usual, and also I am running on time with the new chapter (9) and I need to go finish writing it as my quota is at least a chapter a week!

					P.S.

					I gave myself (the owner of the website) a chapter writing quota.

					Hi! I am back again and today with great news, today I am planning on remaking the table of contents for the lore book, and I will add separate stories as indented items in a markdown list to make it easier to get to a particular story in the book, also I want to make some small changes to the website and it will be it for today, I had some trouble because we had Canada, Ontario in particular, get covered in a lot of snow, and because of that it was harder to do my work when there is a snow storm outside your window. But not gonna' cry about snow near my house and more about the work! Also I am planing on adding more boards to the imageboard.

					Edit: The lore book table of contents remake took me way too long ðŸ˜­

					## 14.02.2025

					I wasn't writing for a long time, and I am happy to be back! Todays news are that DSchan is now online and I resolved all of the connection problems, so now it will be 24/7 online and there ofcourse is going to be a special board for Stickman-Stories! So, if you still didn't see it you can go to the home page for the announcements and the second line has a link to DSchan, just click it and it will open the website in a new tab. I hope everyone will like it and there is not going to be hate between this community and people on the website before I gave the link to it here. So I hope you got the idea, good luck everyone!

					Also out of website updates there is a CSS update, though it was quite small, but the main part is that there is a new 8<sup>th</sup> chapter about a protest! So if you are hyped-up you can go check it out! Also I am planning on finishing the 3<sup>rd</sup> story and starting to write the 9<sup>th</sup> chapter. So, get ready for new lore drop! :)

					## 07.02.2025

					I am glad to announce that I am soon launching an imageboard similar to 4chan, it's name is Dschan. It is going to be runing on my own web server and it will actually have a database and all of that "nerdy" stuff. But the main idea is that soon it will become public, though there is a chance that it will have connection problems, but at least it should work most of the times. So, soon it will become public!

					## 04.02.2025

					I sadly skipped a few days of noting but this is probably because first I was on weekends, second I was streaming that day so, I didn't actually do that much, probably because I had to talk to the computer. So, because of that all I didn't really had time left to actually add something, though I still work on remaking the vehichles wiki page. So, there is not that much to say besides that as I said already, I am remaking the vehichles page and also I added some more code to the comic css file, so I hope everyone liked the new changes, and pretty much that's it.

					---

					## 02.02.2025

					I'm glad to be back! It is already February and it is a brand new day to start work! First of, of course I updated this page and I am planing on updating the lore book. Soon there is going to be a cool update though, so stay informed comrades!

					---

					## 30.01.2025

					So, today when I went to check the github issues and pull request I realized that no one wants to finish the chapter 7 so I started work on my own :(. But anyways this is not a big deal as I really like to write the lore. Besides that I checked for bugs made some small updates, but today was not the most interresting one though.

					Also for the updates on the website here is a short description of all that:

					- Updated this blog :)
					- Also I plan on adding a table of contents to the lore book
					- And I also think about adding on to the wiki and the lore because I feel that right now it's the thing we need to do now the most.

					For today that's pretty much it.

					---

					## 29.01.2025

					It is soon the end of January and I am glad to say that I have added some changes to the website, well they are not really changes just some improvements, but, anyways. So, first let's start off with me fixing the titles on the wiki pages, next I realized we had a guy named "sanwalsulehri" who wanted to help me on the issue [#52](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues/52) but I already finished it though I forgot to close it, and because of that he wrote that he can help but I already fixed it, so I excused to him and explained the situation, but he was gone, so I realized, it's time to finally update the special thanks render, so I went to work! Besides all of this drama I also just worked on sustaining the site, basically some simple stuff. Later in the day(basically one hour later) I went to update this blog, and right now writing it.

					P.S.

					I usually start my day in 08:30AM and my daily job on the site is to maybe close some issues, open a few myself, then I usually start just keeping the website up to date, if I feel creative I can even add on to the lore book, but all together that's it!

					---

					## 28.01.2025

					I am glad to say that I have made a blog page for the website and here I am planing on writing stuff about the development my ideas, maybe even announce my projects besides this one. But besides all of this yapping about the blog I just wanted to tell everyone who helped me with this - "Thankyou very much!"

					I am planing on updating this page every while or so. I still don't have a lot of projects right now, so I think there is no point in telling them to you, but if you are interrested you can always check out my [dot files](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Dot-files) especially if you are planing on helping me with development of the website, also I made a simple chat app made in python which works in console, but there is a problem with it as it doesn't work properly, so if you are interrested in webcode you can always go check out [this link](https://github.com/Capybaric123/remacc) to go to the project repo.
