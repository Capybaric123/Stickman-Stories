					## 30.01.2025

					So, today when I went to check the github issues and pull request I realized that no one wants to finish the chapter 7 so I started work on my own :(. But anyways this is not a big deal as I really like to write the lore. Besides that I checked for bugs made some small updates, but today was not the most interresting one though.

					It is soon the end of January and I am glad to say that I have added some changes to the website, well they are not really changes just some improvements, but, anyways. So, first let's start off with me fixing the titles on the wiki pages, next I realized we had a guy named "sanwalsulehri" who wanted to help me on the issue [#52](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues/52) but I already finished it though I forgot to close it, and because of that he wrote that he can help but I already fixed it, so I excused to him and explained the situation, but he was gone, so I realized, it's time to finally update the special thanks render, so I went to work! Besides all of this drama I also just worked on sustaining the site, basically some simple stuff. Later in the day(basically one hour later) I went to update this blog, and right now writing it.

					P.S.

					I usually start my day in 08:30AM and my daily job on the site is to maybe close some issues, open a few myself, then I usually start just keeping the website up to date, if I feel creative I can even add on to the lore book, but all together that's it!

					I am glad to say that I have made a blog page for the website and here I am planing on writing stuff about the development my ideas, maybe even announce my projects besides this one. But besides all of this yapping about the blog I just wanted to tell everyone who helped me with this - "Thankyou very much!"

					I am planing on updating this page every while or so. I still don't have a lot of projects right now, so I think there is no point in telling them to you, but if you are interrested you can always check out my [dot files](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Dot-files) especially if you are planing on helping me with development of the website, also I made a simple chat app made in python which works in console, but there is a problem with it as it doesn't work properly, so if you are interrested in webcode you can always go check out [this link](https://github.com/Capybaric123/remacc) to go to the project repo.
