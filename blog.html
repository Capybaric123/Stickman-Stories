					## 28.01.2025

					I am glad to say that I have made a blog page for the website and here I am planing on writing stuff about the development my ideas, maybe even announce my projects besides this one. But besides all of this yapping about the blog I just wanted to tell everyone who helped me with this - "Thankyou very much!"

					I am planing on updating this page every while or so. I still don't have a lot of projects right now, so I think there is no point in telling them to you, but if you are interrested you can always check out my [dot files](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Dot-files) especially if you are planing on helping me with development of the website, also I made a simple chat app made in python which works in console, but there is a problem with it as it doesn't work properly, so if you are interrested in webcode you can always go check out [this link](https://github.com/Capybaric123/remacc) to go to the project repo.
