# Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project you are always welcome, thought there is going to be a few rules for it.

## Comics and Scripts

If you want to help us with making new comic pages, adding on to the lore book or giving ideas for us to create new comic pages, you need to know a set of rules for contributing.

| Action | Comment |
| :----- | :------ |
| New chapter | If you want to add a new chapter to the lore book you need to ***NOT USE JOKES ABOUT TRAGEDIES!*** |
| New comic | If you want to make a new comic for the website you need to ***KEEP IT PG-13*** |
| New idea | If you have an idea for a new comic, but you can't make it real yourself you can email: [dancho321sorokin@gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=dancho321sorokin@gmail.com) |

## Issues

| Action | Comment |
| :----- | :------ |
| Add an issue | If you want to make an issue from a bug you found you are always free to do so, but I would want you to make sure it is simple to read and not too long, as that makes it significantly harder to fix the issue without a good description. |
| Close an issue | If you want to help us with closing/fixing issues you are always free to do so, just make a fork of the repository, do the bugfix, and then for the last you can make a pull request with a mark of the issue, i.e. "Fixed #issue hash" |

## Improvements

This theme doesn't need a separate table for it as it is quite simple.

You just fork the repository then you make your improvements, after you are done, you can make a pull request describe what you have changed and then submit it! When I will notice it I will read through your description and if it seems as a usefull addition(basically anything) your pull request will be merged to the main branch and your changes will appear on the website itself.

## Personal Comments

I am very glad that all of you want to help me in all of those ways as I already have around 5 contributors in a few month that this site existed, and I am very proud of all of you for your help, and skills. This is all for the rules, basically nothing special, the same rules as all of the other repos'.
