# Stickman-Stories

This is a site made for my own webcomic.
The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
Also the site is using the md-block code for markdown rendering to make creating pages easier and the site is built using jekyll static page build system.
I will probably make a discussions page for you guys to 
chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. 
I hope everyone likes the comic.

## About

The idea of making a webcomic was a thrill for me since the moment I learned coding, I was always interrested in such things and I had tons of comics and comic pages at home, some of them were just one page long, but some of them were special, if I was interrested in continuing the story for some reason (usually it was because I liked the idea) I'd make an extra page of the comic, and because of that some of my comics were up to **50 pages** because they were so interesting to make. 

Of course there was a lot more of other things I was inspiring of while creating the stickman stories itself, those are: **[Lackadaisy](https://lackadaisy.com/)** a very cool webcomic, it gave me the idea of making a website, and **[Chicken Gun](https://chicken-gun.fandom.com/wiki/Chicken_Gun_Wiki)** a game made by a small developer which became very popular in ru comunity, I was inspired by the fights from there and initially the webcomic idea was to make a comic about chicken gun, but I thought it will be too hard to make it so I finally came up with an idea of creating the stickman stories.

## Software Usage

In case you found this website software interresting and want to use it for your own comics, 
you can access me via email using this adress: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=dancho321sorokin@gmail.com" target="_blank">dancho321sorokin@gmail.com</a>

When you got the software you can also check out the [user guide](USER-GUIDE.md) for information about software usage and guides to how to use the website and how to make pages for comics and for the wiki, if you need it of course.

P.S.
There is a chance that you will need to wait for a while, because the software dev is a bit lazy ;-)

## Comic Creation

For help see [COMIC-REQUESTS.md](COMIC-REQUESTS)

## Troubleshooting

If you find any issues you can always report them using the [github issues tab](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues) for this project.
Try to explain it as simple as possible because reading through a bunch of issues where you need to read 12 pages to understand what is wrong 
is a bit exausting.

## Wiki

There is a wiki page for this comic made by the comic author what means that it will contain only actual information from the comic and also will be checked and moderated for any bugs or issues which can cause misunderstanding. So go check it out right now or else there is a chance that you will not understand what is this whole thing about as there is a lot of explanation to stuff in the comic as well as the lore book which you can find at the main or home page.

## Discussions

There is a discussion page for this website on github and also a room on gitter where you can chat about the comic series and also just chill and hangout, so I recomend on going back to the top of te page and clicking on that button which literally said ***chat on gitter***. So if you have any ideas how to improve the website or an idea for a new comic you can always tell that in the github discussions page, even though I recomend contacting me on my email which was shown earlier in the page in case you want to give me a new idea for a comic, but I hope you got te idea right, and if you just want to chat about your favourite or maybe not really comic series you can follow the button at the top of the page to see the gitter and also get and invite there. So good luck on your journey in to the fun and sometimes terrifying lore of the stickman-stories!
