					# Stickman-Stories

					Welcome to **Stickman-Stories**, my personal webcomic project! This site is dedicated to sharing the adventures and tales of stickman characters through the medium of digital comics. It is a work of passion that has evolved over time, combining my love for comics with my journey in web development. I hope you enjoy the stories as much as I enjoy creating them!
					
					The site itself is built using HTML and CSS, with a dash of JavaScript to make it interactive. While the JavaScript involved is relatively simple, it serves the purpose of enhancing the user experience. A special shout-out goes to the creators of **md-block**, which has been an incredible tool for creating this site, and **Jekyll**, the static site generator that powers both the website and the webcomic code.
					
					As the community grows, I plan to introduce a discussions page, where fans and readers can engage, share feedback, and suggest new ideas for future comic strips. I hope this helps cultivate an interactive space for everyone involved!
					
					I hope you enjoy the comic and feel free to contribute your ideas. It's all about building a creative space where we can all share and explore new ideas.

					## About
					
					The idea of creating a webcomic has been an exciting endeavor for me ever since I learned to code. Comics have always fascinated me, and I've had an extensive collection at home. Some of these comics were short one-page stories, while others were extensive multi-page epics. There was always a sense of satisfaction in creating more when I felt inspired. In fact, I’ve made a few comics that reached up to **50 pages** because I couldn’t stop exploring the ideas that I loved.
					
					One of the major inspirations behind **Stickman-Stories** was my love for storytelling and creative expression. While I initially envisioned a comic based on the game **Chicken Gun** (a game developed by a small studio that gained a significant following in the Russian community), I realized that creating a comic about the game’s characters and universe would be challenging. Instead, I decided to go with the concept of stick figures, which allowed for a more flexible and fun approach to storytelling.
					
					In addition to **Chicken Gun**, another major influence on the comic’s development was the webcomic **Lackadaisy**. Its rich storytelling, incredible artwork, and the idea of creating a professional webcomic really resonated with me. **Lackadaisy** inspired me to design my own website for **Stickman-Stories** and focus on bringing the same level of quality to my own work.

					## Software Usage
					
					If you're inspired by the setup of this website and are considering building something similar for your own webcomic or personal project, feel free to reach out. I’m more than happy to provide advice and share the software I used to build this website. Whether you're interested in the technical side of things or just curious about how it all works, don’t hesitate to contact me via email at:
					
					<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=dancho321sorokin@gmail.com" target="_blank">dancho321sorokin@gmail.com</a>
					
					**Note:** Please be patient if you don't receive a quick response. The software development side of this project is something I work on in my free time, so sometimes replies may take a little longer!

					## Troubleshooting
					
					If you encounter any issues with the website or the webcomic, I encourage you to report them via the [GitHub issues tab](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues). When submitting an issue, please try to keep your description as clear and concise as possible. The easier it is for me to understand the problem, the quicker I can address it. It's always a bit draining to sift through lengthy explanations to figure out what's going wrong, so simple and direct reports are always appreciated.

					## Wiki
					
					There is a dedicated **wiki** for **Stickman-Stories**, maintained by me, the comic's creator. The wiki serves as a comprehensive guide to the comic's universe, its characters, and the lore behind it. Since I am the author, the information there will always be accurate and up-to-date. However, be aware that the wiki primarily focuses on what’s included in the comic, so it won’t delve too much into outside lore or the development of the website itself.
					
					You can explore the wiki to find detailed explanations of various elements from the comic, which will help you understand the story better. It’s a great place to start if you’re new to **Stickman-Stories**. However, there may also be a **community-driven wiki** that contains more in-depth details, fan theories, and additional content. If you want to dive deeper into the universe or uncover hidden secrets, I suggest checking out both resources.
					
					> Remember that the wiki on the website is mostly technical in nature and will mostly cover content already visible in the comic. For more extensive background information, you might want to explore community-driven wikis.

					## Discussions
					
					I want to foster a collaborative space where you, the readers, can share your thoughts and ideas for future comic strips or additions to the website. There are two main places where you can engage:
					
					1. **GitHub Discussions** – This is the primary place for sharing **comic ideas** or discussing new features for the site. If you have a cool concept or an idea for a new part of the comic, this is the best spot to post it. I actively monitor this area, so feel free to share your creativity.
					
					2. **Gitter** – This platform is more casual and focused on **chatting and socializing**. You can use Gitter to discuss your ideas with other fans, ask for opinions, or simply talk about the comic in a laid-back setting. While Gitter is great for casual discussions, I’d recommend posting formal suggestions and comic ideas on GitHub to ensure they don’t get lost in the conversation.
					
					In short: **GitHub Discussions** for formal ideas, and **Gitter** for informal chat. Both spaces are valuable for building a community around the comic.

					## Special Thanks

					If you saw the special thanks render/poster in the bottom of the page you probably know what I am talking about, if you want to get there, here is a list of actions you need to do:

					1. Find an open issue, you can see how much there are also on the main page

					2. Make a fork of the repository on github

					3. Fix and test the issue

					4. Make a pull request to the main branch

					That's everything you need to get on the special thanks render. I hope this helped, also if you want to help me for example by making your own comic pages, or adding on to the lore in the lorebook, you are always free to fork the project and make a pull request with your new idea, and if you're lucky you might also get not only on the render, but also get your comic to sit gracefully on one of the pages of the website!

					Feel free to explore the content, get involved in the community, and don't hesitate to reach out with your thoughts and suggestions. Together, we can continue making **Stickman-Stories** the best webcomic it can be!
