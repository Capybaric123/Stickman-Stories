                ## The begining of the war
                
                The war began rapidly like a wild fire, at first it was just a bunch of blufor and redfor scout drones here and there, but then... *On November 12<sup>th</sup> 2020 blufor after secretly getting information about the west border* from the scout drones which were constantly getting hit out of the sky and a few people who were ready to sell information about the country to blufor for money, blufor attack squadron 12 made a plan on how to catch the enemy off guard and claim around 20 kilometers of land in one bomb run which will mean that they will also get access to the left over tanks and other millitary equipment produced by the countries in friendly relationship with redfor which for obvious reasons they won't sell to the blufor as then that will count as a betrayal to the redfor and they will start increasing their forces on the countries. But we went off the topic, so let's continue. The blufor 12th attack squadron consisting of two A10Cs and 5 AV8Bs started their jets and filled their weapon racks with cluster bombs, maverics, dummy bombs, and hydra rocket pods moved out. Two hours passed and the 12th attack squadron is already at the border, they started to perform their plan and soon they met the enemy's triple A. One hour in to the battle and there is the first mig-29 coming from the east, you might think that they were helpless in this situation, but in this case you would be very wrong since the AV8B also has the air to air capabilities and even some radar guided weapons, so the mig-29 wasn't a big deal. By the next day the mission was acomplished and blufor had no losses, unlike redfor which 3 mig-29s were destroyed. The attack squadron 12 returned back to the base after acomplishing the mission.
                    
                ## The begining of something bad
                    
                The redfor did not want to just take that and let it go - the war was declared and the redfor helicopter squadron 3 was called to destroy the 5 APCs in the teritory. But it wasn't instant though, cause' you might think that they would send the helicopters instantly to counter attack, nut no. Redfor waited until id is December and the new wave of enemy will arive, redfor were planing the defence plan for a month and finally they could finaly use it in action. After planing every move the enemy might take, redfor send their helicopters to destroy the blufor APCs and they did it successfully as the APCs were exploding with 7 or 10 people in them one by one soldiers screaming runing in fear and teror, only a few survived, though they were jelous for the ones who were dead. Wounded and scared the few returned back to the friendly lands.
                
                ## The journey
                
                Soon after the attack by the redfor commander Michael and two more people in his squad decide to start moving further even though everyone else already left the battlefield they stayed. They walked for what seemed as an eternity, but soon they saw a small command center built out of simple materials like pipes and tarp found in the ruins of the city, it was an improvised redfor command center and as soon as Michael and his squad saw movement inside they instantly hid behind the corner of the first building they found near them. There was a big antena sticking out of the improvised shelter which probably was used to have better connection as they were far away from the closest spot with good internet connectivity. One of the soldiers in Michael's squad said that he had a granade and he planed on throwing te granade in the shelter and right after that blocking the path outside with a big shelf they found near the enemy hideout. Michael was conserned about the plan and the fact that they will also need to hide from the explosion too, but the soldier had a plan for this as they could hide behind the same shelf that they will use to block the entarance. This sounded like a good plan but still there was a chance that they will get spoted before they will be able to throw the granade. They still started to perform the plan as said, first they started with getting in to position and ready for the throw, second they already pulled the pin on the granade, and third they threw the granade in the room and closed off the exit with a shelf while also hiding behind it. Soon after they threw the granade 2 people screamed trying to escape but the exit was closed and right after that the room filled with the sound of a very loud explosion from the granade detonating inside with the two unlucky people who were inside the room with the granade.

                ## The abrams field

                Soon after the attack on the APC squad by the redfor union blufor state decided to send out a squad consisting of 4 M1A2s to te battle to check for survivors from the blufor and/or redfor, but soon after they moved out and saw the completely destroyed city they almost lost their hope, but they still didn't give up hoping that at least someone would survive. And we know that it is true as the squad leaded by Michael is still located somwhere in the destroyed Vilongrad and needed help. The squad made a descision to split-up and search the city for survivours. While the tanks are searching for people Michael and his squad managed to connect to the radio frequency of the friendly base and informed them about their location and that they need to be extracted as they are waiting for the new wave of enemy, as soon as the friendly radio started emiting sound the people at the base were already curious about who managed to connect to their radio, and after hearing the call for help they imidietly informed the tank squad about the people who are stuck in the city and thheir location. The resque mission started, but the feeling that the enemy was right around te corner didn't go away.
                
                ## The resque mission

                After the tank squad dislocated in the city of Vilongrad got the information about a blufor squad stuck in the city they started to move out as they were supposed to get tere as fast as possible since the enemy was getting closer to the city on their tanks and cars. There was no time to wait but the tanks aren't the fastest vehichles in the world as you might know what means that the lost squad will need to defend them selfes from the enemy for at least 20 minutes. The tanks were already 4 kilometers away, and the enemy was already there, Michael gave an order to take cover in the nearest basement and stay silent, so in case the enemy goes in to check what is happening they will get ambushed by Michaels squad and possibly without getting noticed. 10 minutes left and those were the longest 10 minutes in their lives as the footsteps grew closer and the roar of the engines was getting louder, the hope was dissapearing fast. Someone steped in to the basement, Michael and his squadmates were ready for death, but no! It was the tank squad who made it first to them, but there is no time to cheer as the enemy won't wait for them to finish their buisnes, and they needed to get out as fast as possible. But there is this thing about tanks... they only can cary the personale and that's it, but they needed to get out fast so they improvised and Michael's squad was riding on top of the turret. and in less than an hour they got away without any trouble except the possible mental trauma after spending so much time in fear of death itself.

                ## The air attack

                It is already two month since the war started and there is already a battle at the frontline, but the battle goes on not only on the ground but also in the skyes. On January 4<sup>th</sup> 2021 the radar of a blufor E-3 Sentry caught three SU-27s in the blufor airspace, their intentions were unknown so the awacs informed the nearest flying formaiton of air to air capable planes to go and intercept the three SU-27s soon a formation of five F-16 block-50s were sent there and heading towards the enemy planes, after half an hour of flying towards eachother one of the F-16s radars finally noticed a radar contact in 20 miles away from the formation, and after confirmation from the awacs that it is the enemy the formation split up and started attacking the SU-27s but it could not be performed as they were too far away from the enemy to fire any missile as F-16 can only carry heat-seaking AIM-9Xs and AIM-120Cs which are short and medium range missiles they can't do anything, and while they were waiting for the enemy aircraft to get in range for engagement another SU-57 appeared like from nowhere what caused panic in the formation but they still while losing one of their friendly F-16 managed to get rid of the enemy stealth jet, but while they were bussy defending the SU-27s already were in range with their missiles and already fired them in to the formation out of now on four F-16s three more airplanes destroyed and there is only one plane left from the formation which chose to flee, but not because the pilot was scared but because the command said so. He barely made it. This was the first time when the blufor aircraft lost to redfor.

                ## The kamikaze drone

                On January 9<sup>th</sup> 2021 a redfor kamikaze drone was detected in the area of the battlefield, all of the tank squads were informed, but they couldn't expect that one of the damaged tanks won't get the message because of the radio issues. The squad inside the tank did not expect the drone to come as they had no clue. Soon the buzzing of the drone came, when everyone except them left their vehichles they did not expect it, the drone was getting louder and louder while everyone hid they didn't and soon the friendly helicopter from fifty miles away using it's thermal cameras noticed a cloud of warm air, and a giant explosion. Only two survived one of them died a few minutes later in the same tank and the other one lost one of his eyes and a leg. It was a horrible day for everyone there and everyone had a minute of silence later at the base, as it was not their fault.

                ## The deadly engeneering

                Soon after the war hit one year in length, the blufor head quarters decided that they need to start trying to find ways to get to the enemy without taking fire, and the engeneers started their work. Half a year later they have invented a very early version of a teleport machine, and at this point you might think that blufor will win the war, but the redfor didn't just wait for blufor to invent a teleport machine, they as soon as one of their spyes told them about the blufor's intentions the leader of redfor commanded the engeneers to start making a device to intercept the teleports made by blufor and redirect people straight to redfor base where they would get instantly killed by the soldiers who will be working two duties so it won't be possible for them to secretly sneek in to the redfor base while no one sees them. But blufor as soon as they found out about what redfor is planning they canceled the test until the teleport machine was compact enough to bring it in a backpack and control it using a laptop so field engeneers will be able to set it up in a minute or two and instead of droping in from an airplane just safely teleport in to a safe spot on the battlefield.

                ## The madman

                After the first generation of a portal machine was canceled due to danger in using, the one scientist who was working on improving the machine started his work, as months passed he was working every day on his job. After half a year, he finally finished the project, and since this time everyone was quiet about the research redfor did not know that there is a second generation of the portal machine, when he was done he presented it to the head quarter and no one else. After they tested the partable teleport machine and it came successful, the training started to teach troops how to use it as it still needed a laptop to function. The training was successful, and the scientist with now 3 more people was working on the third generation of the portal machine, but now they could work slower as they were not forced to invent a new version, they were just improving it to work without a laptop.

                ## The field testing

                After the work on the second generation of the teleport machine was finished and the troops were trained, the machine was field tested right in the battle. The engeneer with three more riflemen carefully traveled through the battlefield to the flank, placed the teleporter, hooked it up to the laptop with the needed software, and launched it. Soon the teleporter's head started spinning faster and faster until it was imposible to see it clearly, and soon after that troops started appearing from literally nowhere. And they captured the objective, it was a big enemy base with bomb shelters and lots of ammunition and weapons which were also stolen by the blufor army. And after the operation was complete the traveled back the same way. The testing was successful and the teleport machine was from now on in every field engeneer's backpack.

                ## The war machine

                After blufor invented the teleport machine, redfor leader demanded that they need to build a mech for big operations, soon after the work started. They needed a reliable mech which would survive shots from rifles, and also be compatable of using different weapons for different operations. First came the base, next came the weapons system, then came the weapons, and after came the thrustors. It was perfect, but it still wasn't tested...

                ## See that thing?

                It's already the end of 2024 and the redfor after reciveing a message that their south border is being attacked send out 10 T\-160 main battle tanks which were also being developed with the mech, 3 mech suits v1, and 4 helicopters with long-range missiles to help the ground troops protect the border. There was around 60 troops on feet and 20 in cars, first \- helicopters attacked the cars, and after came the mechs, and by the time when the tanks arived the battlefield was filled with corpses of dead blufor soldiers. The mech got a nickname in blufor's army \- the flying death.

                ## Mid air revenge

                Three months passed after the first contact of bufor with the mech suit v1 was recorded, the redfor are already working on the v2 but v1 is still in use and there is already around 10 of them existing, some even having battle scars. It was a suspiciously calm and quiet day for both redfor and blufor as no one was in a fight, but this was until one trained marine sent by redfor didn't come to the testing range of blufor where there was a airplane flying around. The marine in the mech aimed at the aircraft and fired a burst of 20 mm in to the airplane, both of it's engines were destroyed and the aircraft went in to a flat spin, the pilot was commanded to instantly eject but he was not ready to get shot at as soon as he ejects. So relying only on auxilary power from the batteries in the plane he waited out for the perfect timing and shot a burst of 30 mm slashing the mech in two pices including the person inside it. He successfully ejected from the aircraft right befor it was too late for the parachute to open fully, and he landed safely, what you can't tell about the aircraft which he was testin. He was rewarded with a medal of honour. And writen to the pages of the world's history.
